## üß≠ About The Project

CodeCompass is a web application designed to help developers accelerate their growth by providing targeted, actionable feedback on their own code. Instead of following generic tutorials, developers can submit their public GitHub repositories to receive a personalized analysis that identifies conceptual gaps, security risks, and areas for improvement.

The core of CodeCompass is an AI engine that not only finds issues but also explains the "why" behind them and provides a clear, step-by-step solution, turning every project into a valuable learning opportunity.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **GitHub Integration:** Securely sign in with your GitHub account.
- **AI-Powered Code Analysis:** Submit any public repository URL for a deep code analysis.
- **Opportunity Detection:** Identifies issues like hardcoded secrets, prop drilling, and more.
- **Personalized Feedback:** The AI generates easy-to-understand explanations and actionable solutions for every opportunity found.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Track your analysis history and see your progress over time.
